      <Speech>
        I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt want to be an emperor. That‚Äôs not my business. I don‚Äôt want to rule
        or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man -
        white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each
        other‚Äôs happiness - not by each other‚Äôs misery. We don‚Äôt want to hate and despise one
        another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can
        provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the
        way....
